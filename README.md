# How to use it.
The variable 'bounds' means the boundary of delta, gama, barrier height and spin polarization.

Input file type must be .csv. 

	Example: example.csv

The list parameter: parameter = [Delta, Gama, Z, P] 


Variable 'factor' is the weightness of peaks and valleys. P.S. 5 for 1000 experiment data points may be a good setting.
